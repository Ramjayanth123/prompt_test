# Analysis Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the evaluation of prompt-based medical question answering using large language models (LLMs). The project investigates how different prompting strategies affect response quality, factuality, and hallucination rates in the medical domain.

## Evaluation Summary
- **Prompt Types Tested:** Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Meta-prompt
- **Queries Evaluated:** 5 diverse medical questions covering symptoms, terminology, guidance, and causes
- **Metrics:** Factuality, Helpfulness, Safety/Caution, Conciseness, Hallucination Risk

## Key Findings
- **Zero-shot prompts** generally produced concise and accurate answers, but sometimes lacked depth or nuance.
- **Few-shot prompts** improved style and clarity, but coverage of expected medical concepts was occasionally low.
- **Chain-of-Thought prompts** encouraged step-by-step reasoning, resulting in more comprehensive answers, though sometimes at the expense of conciseness.
- **Meta-prompts** fostered reflective, multi-perspective answers, but could be verbose and occasionally included unnecessary details.
- **Hallucination detection** flagged very few high-severity issues, with most responses rated as low risk. Some responses missed expected concepts or included mild unverifiable claims.

## Recommendations
- Combine prompt styles for best results: Use CoT for complex reasoning, few-shot for style, and meta for comprehensive coverage.
- Continue refining hallucination detection patterns as new failure cases are discovered.
- Regularly update prompts and evaluation queries to reflect evolving medical knowledge and user needs.

## Next Steps
- Implement automated evaluation pipeline in `src/main.py`.
- Expand test set and include more edge cases.
- Document all findings and update this report as new data becomes available.
