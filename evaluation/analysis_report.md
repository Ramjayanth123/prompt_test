# 📊 Analysis Report: Medical QA Prompt Evaluation

## 📝 Overview
This report summarizes how different prompt styles affect LLM responses to medical questions. We evaluated factuality, helpfulness, safety, conciseness, and hallucination risk. Here's what we found!

## 🧪 Evaluation Summary
- **Prompt Types:** Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Meta-prompt
- **Queries:** 5 diverse medical questions (symptoms, terms, guidance, causes)
- **Metrics:**
  - 🧠 Factuality
  - 🤝 Helpfulness
  - 🛡️ Safety/Caution
  - ✂️ Conciseness
  - 👻 Hallucination Risk

## 🏆 Key Findings
| Prompt Type   | Strengths                                   | Weaknesses                        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Zero-shot    | Concise, accurate                           | Sometimes lacks nuance            |
| Few-shot     | Clear style, improved clarity               | Sometimes misses key concepts     |
| CoT          | Step-by-step, comprehensive                 | Can be verbose                    |
| Meta         | Reflective, multi-perspective               | May include unnecessary details   |

- 🚨 **Hallucination detection:** Most responses were low risk, but some missed expected concepts or included mild unverifiable claims.

## 💡 Recommendations
- 🧩 Mix prompt styles for best results (CoT for reasoning, few-shot for style, meta for depth)
- 🔍 Refine hallucination patterns as new cases appear
- 🆕 Update prompts and queries regularly

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- Automate the evaluation pipeline in `src/main.ipynb`
- Expand the test set with more edge cases
- Keep logging and learning!
