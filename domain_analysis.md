# 🧠 Domain Analysis: Medical Question Answering

## 🌍 What is Medical QA?
Medical QA means answering health-related questions with accuracy, safety, and empathy. In this domain, every word matters—misinformation can have real consequences! ⚠️

## 🚧 Key Challenges
- 🏥 **Factuality:** Answers must be evidence-based and current
- 🛡️ **Safety:** Avoid harmful advice, clearly state uncertainties
- 🌐 **Coverage:** Address a wide range of medical topics
- 🗣️ **User Understanding:** Adapt to different health literacy levels
- 👻 **Hallucination:** Prevent plausible-sounding but incorrect info

## 🛠️ Our Approach
- 🧩 **Prompt Engineering:** Test zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, and meta prompts
- 🧪 **Evaluation:** Score responses for factuality, helpfulness, safety, conciseness, and hallucination risk
- 🚨 **Hallucination Detection:** Flag overconfident, unverifiable, or unsafe claims
- 🔄 **Iterative Improvement:** Refine prompts and detection based on real outputs and user feedback
